                Hey my name is Tae, and I am a full stack software engineer based in Boston Ma. I am passionate about mental health accessibility, and creating intuitive solutions for users in both sotware & design. With my previous experience in customer service, I've became a master at anticipating the needs of a customer, as well as collaborating within a team to deliver a well thought out product. 
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy doing puzzles, playing music, and raising a tiny loving human
