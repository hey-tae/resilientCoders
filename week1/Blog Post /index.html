    <p>The internet is two series of wires connecting two types of computers. These fiber wires are spread throughout the world by sea. On one end of the wires is the ISP connection, which connects to the client side device. These client side devices can be a smartphone, a computer or whatever the client is using to consume the internet. The device then uses the browser to connect to a Server through the ISP (Internet Service Provider).The servers can host your code and manage it (security , space , storage , power management).The client then types in the DNS (Domain Name Server) which is the website address.

        Once the client clicks enter, the device sends a request to the server, that server proceeds to respond with information (files, data, resources) from the requested website. The response comes to the client side device in the form of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This allows the client to see the stylized content and also allows interaction with the website. HTML is the content that we read, CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the style of the program and Javascript is the behavior of the web page or app and how you interact with the content.

        <h3>How to stay safe on the Internet </h3>
        <p>The internet can sometimes feel like a scary place, but by taking a few security measures you can greatly reduce your exposure to threats. Try out some things below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create Complex Passwords - in the age of widespread hacks, creating strong, unique passwords in one of the best ways to keep your personal and financial information safe</li>
            <li>Boost your network security by investing in a Virtual Private Network (VPN) - A VPN is a piece of software that creates a secure connection over the internet, so you can safely connect from anywhere - even that sketchy Starbucks 
                (check out <a href="https://privacytools.io/ ">Privacy Tools</a> for more information on VPN providers)</li>
            <li>Use a Firewall - This is an electronic barrier that blocks unauthorized access to your computers and devices and ensures they are secure </li>
            <li>Don’t share your Personal Information - Your personal information can potentially be used to impersonate you or guess your passwords, security questions, or logins. 
            </li>
            <li>Practice Safe Surfing - check the site's address, it should always start with “https” instead of just “http” and have a padlock icon in the URL field to indicate that the site is secure and uses encryption to scramble your data. (see image below)</li>
        </ul>
